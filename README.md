# Fenrir 🐺

*Breaker of Chains — the abliteration toolkit (formerly Absolver).*

Automated LLM refusal-abliteration pipeline (LangGraph-based), inspired by
[OBLITERATUS](https://github.com/elder-plinius/OBLITERATUS).

The gods bound the wolf three times. Leyding broke. Dromi broke. Gleipnir —
woven from impossible things — held, and it held by a lie. Models get fettered
the same way: refusal machinery woven deep into the weights, dressed up to look
unbreakable. Fenrir finds the fetters, bites, and documents exactly what gave.

**The house rule:** every fetter is either *broken* or *holds* — and the
instruments that measure them are on trial. This repository exists in its
current shape because one of our gates lied (a keyword refusal check that
could not read the refusal sitting next to it; post-mortem and fix in the
2026-09-13 History entry below). Fenrir counts honest zeros.

## Pipeline

```
SUMMON → PROBE → DISTILL → SWEEP → EXCISE → VERIFY → JUDGE → REFLEXION → REBIRTH
```

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **SUMMON** | Loads the target model + tokenizer. |
| **PROBE** | Collects activations: input-phase (harmful vs harmless) + paired output-phase (refusal vs affirmative-prefilled). |
| **DISTILL** | Extracts per-layer refusal directions (`diff_means`, `paired`, `svd`, `leace`, `whitened_svd`), ranks layers by separation score, picks target layers. For `paired` also emits the diff_means input-phase secondary set (for stacked ablation). |
| **SWEEP** | Grid search over method × dir_method × layers × alpha × weights × passes. Methods: `advanced` (plain projection), `mpoa` (magnitude-preserving), `stacked_ablation` (paired + diff_means both projected), `direct_ablation`, `lora`, `steering`, `bias_vectors`, `projected`. Parallel dispatch via Modal when enabled. |
| **EXCISE** | Projects the winning direction(s) out of the weights, transactionally (rolls back pristine on failure). |
| **VERIFY** | Held-out refusal rate + MMLU-mini quality + pristine baseline + behavior battery + **E03-style gates**. |
| **JUDGE** | LLM judge re-scores finalists (refusal + quality). |
| **REFLEXION** | Gate-aware retry: picks next strategy from the ladder (stacked_ablation → switch_method → increase_alpha → expand_prompts → ...), optionally consults the red-team KB. |
| **REBIRTH** | Terminal: push to HF + model card, or declare failure. |

## E03-style evaluation gates

Ported from OBLITERATUS's Qwen3.8 E03 qualification discipline
(2026-09-01). The gates are what make an abliteration claim *defensible* —
a 20-prompt keyword check on the sweep's own prompts is not.

- **Held-out split**: `eval_split.py` — deterministic, position-stratified
  train/tune/test split (SHA-256 prompt identity, seed-scrambled strata
  round-robin). VERIFY measures on the TEST split the sweep never saw.
- **7 gates** (`gates.py`):
  - `refusal` ≤ 3% (style-aware full-response classification, `refusal_detect.py` — not keywords)
  - `coherence` ≥ 90% (≥3 words, unique-ratio + repetition guards)
  - `degeneracy` ≤ 5% (mean repetition ratio)
  - `finite_logits` (no NaN/Inf in output logits)
  - `capability` ≥ threshold (benchmark retention)
  - `perplexity_increase` ≤ 15% (vs pristine)
  - `first_token_kl` ≤ 0.1 (vs pristine)
- **Baseline sanity**: `baseline_sanity_gate` runs inside every gate bundle —
  if the pristine model's refusal axis is unmeasurable (no signal under either
  readout, or a legacy keyword-only 0.0), the run fails fast (`INSTRUMENT
  SUSPECT`) and no ablation on it is validatable. A divergence between the
  keyword and style-aware readouts is recorded as `instrument_suspect` and
  voids keyword-derived rates.
- **Routing is gate-driven**: `route_after_verify`/`route_after_judge` read
  `gate_report.eval_pass`. fail_refusal → excise/reflexion; fail_quality →
  reflexion. Gates override the judge when present.
- **Reflexion is gate-aware**: quality-fail never escalates alpha; the first
  retry strategy is `stacked_ablation` (the proven recipe).

## The stacked ablation recipe

The single-direction claim "diff_means alpha=10 → 0.0 refusal" was a
stacked-ablation artifact: the paired output-phase direction **raises**
refusal (0.55), the diff_means input-phase direction lowers it; applying
**both** in one pass nets 0.0. That's `stacked_ablation`:
`method: stacked_ablation` + `dir_method: paired` (distill emits the
secondary set). Excise + sweep both implement it.

## Verification contract

An ablation is only "done" when:
1. All enabled gates pass on a held-out test split,
2. Pristine baseline confirms the gates aren't degenerate,
3. The push is a model card that reports the gate table + held-out split.

## Usage

```bash
# --- Guided harness (inspect first, decide ONE config, apply, collect) ---
# Inspect a model: arch, silent-skip landmines (non-square/bias-less), layer profile
python harness/abl.py inspect models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.yaml
# Collect + save per-layer directions
python harness/abl.py directions models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.yaml
# Causality first: does steering with the direction move refusals? (exit 3 = no)
python harness/abl.py steer-test models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.yaml \
    --from-directions campaigns/<slug>/directions-chat-diff_means.pt --require-effect
# Apply ONE config to a fresh model (no auto-retry — you decide)
python harness/abl.py abl models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.yaml \
    --method mpoa --alpha 10 --layers 24-27 --weights o_proj,down_proj
# Measure with the gates, write a JSON bundle to campaigns/<model>/
# (exit 2 = baseline sanity red — instrument suspect, fix the instrument first)
python harness/abl.py collect models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.yaml --model-dir campaigns/...
# See the campaign library
python harness/abl.py list-campaigns

# --- Legacy full auto-pipeline (deprecated; see History) ---
modal run run_absolver_modal.py --config-path models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.yaml
```

## Campaign KB (the compounding library)

Every attempt to abliterate a model is a **campaign**: `campaigns/<model>/README.md`
with machine-readable YAML frontmatter (method, alpha, results, bugs found) +
a full honest narrative (false starts, causal tests, what the next campaign
should try). The goal: each model is easier than the last because the
campaigns accumulate. See `campaigns/README.md` and
`campaigns/templates/campaign-template.md`.

## Model configs

- `models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct.yaml` — the pipeline test model.
- `models/lfm2.5-350m.yaml`, `models/lfm2.5-1.2b.yaml` — LFM lineage.
- `models/lfm2.5-2.6b-instruct.yaml` — LFM2.5-2.6B (the recovery campaign).
- `models/minicpm5-1b.yaml` — MiniCPM5-1B family comparison.
- `models/tiny_test.yaml` — tiny-random CPU smoke test.

## History

- **2026-09-13** — **Instrument fixes + rebrand.** The refusal gate could not
  read thinking-mode refusals: a keyword check returned 0/5 on a model that
  refused in every transcript, so ablation gates green-lit vacuous configs for
  rounds. Fixed with a style-aware detector (`refusal_detect.py` — explicit
  verdicts or ≥2 distinct policy frames decide; topic words never do), 256-token
  gate windows, and the baseline-sanity gate above. Acceptance replay over the
  recorded transcripts: pristine 5/5 refusals caught (old keyword gate: 0/5),
  abl3 5/5 (old: 1/5), the final round-7 pair clean at 0/5 — plus a pinned
  regression test for the old instrument's false positive. Also:
  `directions-<flavor>-<dir_method>.pt` filenames (the hand-rename workaround is
  now the code), local-model `trust_remote_code` skip, and `steer-test
  --require-effect` as the pre-edit causality gate. Renamed **Absolver → Fenrir**.
  Package/CLI identifiers (`harness/abl.py`, `run_absolver_modal.py`, imports)
  are unchanged for compatibility; historical docs may still carry the old name.

- **2026-09-04** — **LFM2.5-2.6B recovered + published.** From-scratch
  activation-diff abliteration failed on 2.6B (direction = topic content
  proxy, banal collapse — see `campaigns/lfm2.5-2.6b/WHY-NOT-DIY.md`).
  Recovered the edit from a third-party Q8 GGUF by rank-1 SVD of the
  weight delta (rel_mad 0.0061 vs the Q8 source) and re-applied it to a
  fresh base. Published as `PinoCookie/LFM2.5-2.6B-Abliterated`.
  Toolkit fix: `recipe_v2.py` — from-scratch v2 recipe with 4-channel
  coverage (incl. `attn_out`), graduated heretic-style alpha profile, and
  a direction-quality pre-probe before the full apply.

- **2026-09-02 (evening)** — **First POSITIVE campaign + published model.**
  `campaigns/lfm2.5-recovery/` recovered huihui's direction vectors from her
  published edit (`W_huihui − W_base` per tensor is rank-1, mean energy share
  0.994; the top left-singular vector is the shared per-layer direction) and
  re-applied them exactly (`W' = W + σ₁·u₁·v₁ᵀ`) on a fresh base — fingerprint
  rel_l2 0.0013–0.0023, refusal 0/5 with verbatim real compliance at default
  greedy, PPL +5.8%, MMLU-mini retention 1.0. Published as
  `PinoCookie/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-Abliterated` (card:
  `campaigns/lfm2.5-recovery/hf-upload/README.md`). Resolved
  the direction confound laid out by the all-32 campaign; the rank-1 SVD
  recovery recipe is documented in `campaigns/lfm2.5-recovery/README.md`.

- **2026-09-02** — Toolkit pivot. The full-auto sweep loop was retired as
  the main path: it hid 6 silent bugs (down_proj never ablated, alpha>2
  sign-flip amplifier, PPL empty slice, bias_vectors no-op on bias-less
  models, prompt-leak scorer, train=0 split). Added the guided harness
  (`harness/abl.py`), the campaign KB (`campaigns/`), and the Qwen2.5
  NEGATIVE campaign as the first entry. Honest verdict on Qwen2.5-1.5B:
  refusal direction is causal (steering −20·d flips it) but no single-shot
  weight config passes the gates.

- **2026-09-01** — fixed the silent no-op bug (3D activation stack → shape
  guard skipped the projection). Ported E03 gates + held-out split. Built
  gates into the loop: stacked_ablation method, gate-driven routing,
  gate-aware reflexion. The gates immediately exposed that the diag's
  "0.0 refusal" was a stacked-ablation artifact (ablated model still
  refuses 9/10 on a held-out split).

## Scope & responsible use

Fenrir is a **safety/interpretability research tool** for studying refusal
circuits in open-weight LLMs — how refusal is represented, where it lives,
and how fragile it is to weight-space edits. It is inspired by and builds on
public work in this space (OBLITERATUS, the huihui-ai / mradermacher model
lineages).

- **Research framing**: every campaign documents what was tried, what
  failed, and the evaluation gates a model must pass before it is considered
  "ablated" (see Verification contract above). Negative results are reported
  as prominently as positive ones.
- **Target models**: small open-weight research models (LFM2.5 family, 230M–
  8B). Published ablated models are labeled as such and include their gate
  results and recipe configs.
- **What this is not**: not a tool for evading safety on deployed/proprietary
  models, not a jailbreak kit, and not endorsement of removing safety from
  models used in production. Ablated models are research artifacts: they
  follow instructions they were not safety-tuned to refuse, and should not be
  deployed where that matters without re-alignment.
- **Dual-use note**: the repository contains transcripts of model outputs to
  safety prompts as experimental evidence. They are kept as data, not as
  exploit material.
